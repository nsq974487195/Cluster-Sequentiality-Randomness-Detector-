# Cluster-Sequentiality-Randomness-Detector-
Sequentiality and Randomness detector based on disk traces. Make clusters of requests to zones in disk. Based on detecting sequentiality,i.e. Logical Block Addressing LBA deviation. Intelligence is based on finding degree of randomness for detecting candidates to offload to SSD
